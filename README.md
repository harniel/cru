**Cru - Front End Dev Challenge**

three mock data JSON files:

- Employees: The people who are being rostered
- Shifts: These are the bits of work assigned to employees. If a shift is assigned to an employee, it will have its employee_id property set to an integer matching the id field on the employee.
- Role: The type/label of the shift. Each shift will have a role_id which corresponds to a role.

meet the following guidelines:

- The app should use React as a base framework - any library choices beyond this are up to you.
- The app should display the whole week of rostering information for the employees in the mock data set.
- The roster must be represented in a visualisation of some form - we're looking for something that would aid end users in understanding the information they're being presented with.
